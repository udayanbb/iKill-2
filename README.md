# iKill-2
A 2D iOS Gaming App
#About
I wrote the first version of iKill about five years ago, building my own game engine using mostly Apple's UIKit. 
I am now in the process of rewriting the game code using SpriteKit.
Screenshots of the original game are in the "Screenshots" folder.

Most of the new code is in the file GameScene.m, with further code in Player.m, Ship.m, Weapon.m and Bullet.m
